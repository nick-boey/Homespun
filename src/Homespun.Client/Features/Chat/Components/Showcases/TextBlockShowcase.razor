        Here's what I found in your codebase:

        1. The authentication module is well-structured
        2. There are some unused imports in the utils folder
        3. The API endpoints follow RESTful conventions

        Let me know if you'd like me to address any of these.

The main areas include code organization, where some modules could benefit from better separation of concerns; performance optimization, particularly in the data fetching layer where we could implement caching; and test coverage, which is currently at 65% but could be improved to meet the 80% target. I recommend starting with the authentication module as it's the most critical component and has the least coverage.";
