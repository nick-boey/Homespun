@code {

        Let me analyze the requirements for this feature:

        1. First, I need to understand the current authentication flow. The app uses JWT tokens stored in localStorage, with refresh tokens handled server-side.

        2. For the "Remember me" checkbox:
           - If checked: Set token expiry to 30 days
           - If unchecked: Set token expiry to session only

        3. I should also consider:
           - Security implications of longer token lifetimes
           - The UX of the checkbox placement in the form
           - Whether to persist the checkbox preference itself

        4. Implementation approach:
           - Add a boolean parameter to the login API
           - Store the user preference in localStorage
           - Update the token refresh logic accordingly

        I'll start by modifying the login form component, then update the auth service.
