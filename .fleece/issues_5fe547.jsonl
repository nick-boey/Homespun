{"id":"xJEbSP","title":"Fix session crashes","titleLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00","titleModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","description":"# Bug Investigation: Playwright MCP Serialization Error Causing Container Crashes\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Playwright MCP tools are returning malformed responses that contain .NET type names instead of properly serialized JSON data. This bug appears to be causing container crashes/restarts, with processes being terminated by signals (exit codes 128, 144).\n\n## Evidence\n\n### 1. Malformed Playwright Responses\n\nInstead of returning actual content, Playwright MCP tools return:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nSystem.Collections.Generic.List\u00601[System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary\u00602[System.String,System.Object]]\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis occurs across multiple Playwright tools:\n- \u0060mcp__playwright__browser_navigate\u0060\n- \u0060mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot\u0060\n- \u0060mcp__playwright__browser_click\u0060\n- \u0060mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot\u0060\n- \u0060mcp__playwright__browser_press_key\u0060\n- \u0060mcp__playwright__browser_close\u0060\n\n### 2. Affected Sessions\n\nAnalysis of 11 session logs shows:\n- **72\u002B instances** of this serialization error across 9 session files\n- Sessions with Playwright usage have higher rates of abnormal termination\n- Sessions end abruptly (USER message as last entry) when Playwright is heavily used\n\n### 3. Exit Codes Indicating Signal Termination\n\n| Exit Code | Meaning | Occurrences |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| 128 | Process killed by signal | 24 |\n| 144 | Signal 16 (SIGUSR1) | 4 |\n\nExit codes \u2265128 indicate the process was terminated by a signal, not a normal exit. This suggests the container runtime (Docker) killed the process, likely due to resource exhaustion.\n\n### 4. Connection Errors Following Playwright Usage\n\nMultiple sessions show \u0060ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED\u0060 errors after Playwright tool calls, indicating the server became unavailable mid-session.\n\n## Your Task\n\n1. **Locate the Playwright MCP implementation** - Find where the MCP server handles Playwright tool responses\n\n2. **Identify the serialization bug** - The code is likely calling \u0060.ToString()\u0060 on a \u0060List\u003CDictionary\u003Cstring, object\u003E\u003E\u0060 instead of properly serializing it to JSON. Look for:\n   - Response handling code for Playwright tools\n   - JSON serialization of tool results\n   - Any place where \u0060List\u003C\u003E\u0060 or \u0060Dictionary\u003C\u003E\u0060 types are converted to strings\n\n3. **Check for resource leaks** - The repeated malformed responses may indicate:\n   - Browser instances not being properly disposed\n   - Memory leaks from screenshot/snapshot operations\n   - Unclosed connections or streams\n\n4. **Fix the serialization** - Ensure all Playwright tool responses are properly serialized using \u0060System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Serialize()\u0060 or equivalent, not \u0060.ToString()\u0060\n\n5. **Add error handling** - Ensure Playwright errors don\u0027t crash the MCP server:\n   - Wrap browser operations in try-catch\n   - Properly dispose resources on error\n   - Return structured error responses instead of crashing\n\n## Expected vs Actual Behavior\n\n**Expected:** Playwright tools return JSON-serialized content:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{\n  \u0022content\u0022: [{\u0022type\u0022: \u0022text\u0022, \u0022text\u0022: \u0022Navigation successful\u0022}],\n  \u0022isError\u0022: false\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Actual:** Tools return .NET type name as a string:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nSystem.Collections.Generic.List\u00601[System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary\u00602[System.String,System.Object]]\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Files to Investigate\n\nLook for files related to:\n- MCP server implementation\n- Playwright tool handlers\n- Tool response serialization\n- Any \u0060IToolHandler\u0060 or similar interface implementations\n\nSearch patterns:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n# Find Playwright-related MCP code\nrg -l \u0022playwright\u0022 --type cs\nrg -l \u0022mcp.*tool|tool.*handler\u0022 --type cs -i\n\n# Find serialization code\nrg \u0022List\u003CDictionary\u003Cstring\u0022 --type cs\nrg \u0022ToString\\(\\)\u0022 --type cs -A2 -B2 | grep -i \u0022result\\|response\\|content\u0022\n\n# Find MCP response building\nrg \u0022ToolResult|McpResponse|CallToolResult\u0022 --type cs\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Start a session with Playwright MCP tools enabled\n2. Use any Playwright tool (navigate, click, snapshot, etc.)\n3. Observe the tool response - it should show the .NET type name instead of actual content\n4. After several Playwright operations, the container may crash or become unresponsive\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Playwright tools return properly serialized JSON responses\n- [ ] No .NET type names appear in tool output\n- [ ] Sessions with heavy Playwright usage complete without abnormal termination\n- [ ] Exit codes remain 0 (normal) rather than 128\u002B (signal-terminated)\n- [ ] No \u0060ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED\u0060 errors after Playwright operations\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThis bug only started occurring after Playwright MCP tools were introduced. Sessions without Playwright usage do not exhibit the crash behavior. The correlation between Playwright usage and container crashes is strong across all analyzed session logs.","descriptionLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:33.4317784+00:00","descriptionModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","status":"Closed","statusLastUpdate":"2026-02-03T02:19:22.4903551+00:00","statusModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","type":"Bug","typeLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00","typeModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","linkedIssues":[],"linkedIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00","linkedIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","parentIssues":[],"parentIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00","parentIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","tags":[],"tagsLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00","tagsModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","questions":[],"questionsLastUpdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","executionMode":"Series","createdBy":"Homespun Bot","createdByLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00","lastUpdate":"2026-02-03T02:19:22.4903551+00:00","createdAt":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00"}

This appears to have broken the session display almost entirely - very few messages are displayed other than tool calls in the message window, and there is often a duplicate display of tool calls at the bottom of the chat session.\n\nCould you please review the message caching system, the message format and the history of messages at /data/sessions/ as well as the current chat messages that are being sent to diagnose this issue? A list of the problems include:\n\n- \u0022Thinking\u0022 messages are not being displayed at all.\n- Many tools show up as \u0022Unknown\u0022.\n- Occasionally messages are joined together as they are streamed in when they should really be separated as different \u0022points\u0022. They often appear as joined sentences.\n- The ExitPlanTool and AskUserQuestion tool often show a failed status.\n- Neither the plan or message summary of the plan is shown when the ExitPlanTool is run.\n\nDon\u0027t run a mock session yet, just look at the messages themselves, the message logs and the Homespun code to see if you can diagnose some issues.

{"id":"Gzrifd","title":"Replace ACA session pools with NFS-mounted worker container apps","titleLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","titleModifiedBy":"nick-boey","description":"## Problem\n\nAzure Container Apps session pools do not support volume mounts (confirmed in the 2025-07-01 API). This prevents agent worker containers from sharing a filesystem with the main application container. Currently:\n\n- The Azure Files SMB mount does not support chmod, breaking both Tailscale state and git clone operations\n- Agent workers cannot access cloned repositories on the shared filesystem\n- Each worker must clone repos independently, duplicating data and bandwidth\n\nThe goal is for the main app and all agent containers to mount the same NFS file share and treat repositories as a local filesystem. Agents work in their own git worktrees, minimising file operation conflicts.\n\n## Solution\n\nReplace ACA session pools with regular container apps for agent workers, backed by Azure Files NFS which supports full POSIX permissions. The worker already manages multiple sessions via HTTP API internally (WorkerSessionService), so a single worker container app can handle concurrent sessions without per-session container isolation.\n\n## Work Breakdown\n\n### Phase 1: Infrastructure - VNet \u002B NFS Storage\n\nThe ACA environment requires VNet integration at creation time (cannot be added post-creation), and NFS requires the storage account to be accessible from within that VNet.\n\n1. **Add VNet and subnets to Bicep** - Create a new \u0060network.bicep\u0060 module:\n   - VNet with address space (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)\n   - ACA infrastructure subnet (e.g., 10.0.0.0/23 - ACA requires minimum /23)\n   - Storage private endpoint subnet (e.g., 10.0.2.0/24)\n\n2. **Update environment module** (\u0060modules/environment.bicep\u0060):\n   - Add \u0060vnetConfiguration\u0060 with infrastructure subnet ID\n   - Set \u0060internal: true\u0060 for internal-only environment (Tailscale handles external access)\n\n3. **Switch storage to NFS** (\u0060modules/storage.bicep\u0060):\n   - Change \u0060enabledProtocols\u0060 from \u0060\u0027SMB\u0027\u0060 to \u0060\u0027NFS\u0027\u0060\n   - Set \u0060supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: false\u0060 (NFS requires this)\n   - Keep \u0060Premium_LRS\u0060 / \u0060FileStorage\u0060 (already correct tier)\n\n4. **Add private endpoint for storage** - New \u0060storage-endpoint.bicep\u0060 module:\n   - Create private endpoint for the storage account on the storage subnet\n   - Create private DNS zone for \u0060privatelink.file.core.windows.net\u0060\n   - Link DNS zone to VNet\n\n5. **Update environment storage mount** (\u0060modules/environment.bicep\u0060):\n   - Change from \u0060azureFile\u0060 (SMB with account key) to \u0060nfsAzureFile\u0060 (NFS, no key needed)\n   - NFS uses network-based auth, so \u0060storageAccountKey\u0060 parameter can be removed\n\n### Phase 2: Infrastructure - Worker Container App\n\nReplace the session pool module with a regular container app for workers.\n\n6. **Create worker container app module** (\u0060modules/worker-containerapp.bicep\u0060):\n   - Regular \u0060Microsoft.App/containerApps\u0060 resource (like main app)\n   - Mount the same NFS volume from the environment storage\n   - Volume mount path: \u0060/data\u0060 (same as main app, shared filesystem)\n   - Environment variables: GitHub token, Claude OAuth (from Key Vault secrets)\n   - Ingress: internal only (only accessible within the ACA environment)\n   - Target port: 8080 (worker HTTP API)\n   - Scaling: min 1, max based on \u0060maxConcurrentSessions\u0060 parameter\n   - HTTP scaling rule based on concurrent requests\n   - Include \u0060revisionSuffix\u0060 with deployment timestamp (same pattern as main app)\n\n7. **Update main.bicep**:\n   - Add network module deployment\n   - Pass VNet/subnet IDs to environment module\n   - Replace session pool module with worker container app module\n   - Pass worker container app FQDN as output\n   - Remove session pool outputs, add worker app outputs\n\n### Phase 3: Application - Agent Execution Service\n\nThe worker already handles multiple sessions via its HTTP API (POST /api/sessions, /api/sessions/{id}/message, etc). The main change is how the main app connects to the worker.\n\n8. **Create new execution service** or update \u0060AzureContainerAppsAgentExecutionService\u0060:\n   - Remove all Azure Management API calls for session pool management (no more creating/deleting pool sessions via PUT/DELETE to the sessions API)\n   - Configure worker endpoint as a simple base URL (worker container app\u0027s internal FQDN)\n   - Route all HTTP/SSE calls directly to the worker container app\n   - Session lifecycle: worker manages sessions internally (already implemented in WorkerSessionService)\n   - StartSession: POST to \u0060http://{worker-fqdn}/api/sessions\u0060\n   - SendMessage: POST to \u0060http://{worker-fqdn}/api/sessions/{id}/message\u0060\n   - StopSession: DELETE to \u0060http://{worker-fqdn}/api/sessions/{id}\u0060\n   - Health check: GET \u0060http://{worker-fqdn}/api/health\u0060\n\n9. **Update configuration** (\u0060AgentExecutionOptions.cs\u0060 and \u0060appsettings.json\u0060):\n   - Add \u0060WorkerEndpoint\u0060 setting (internal FQDN of worker container app)\n   - Remove session pool specific settings (SubscriptionId, ResourceGroup, SessionPoolName)\n   - Or keep the existing ACA mode and add a new property for the worker endpoint\n\n10. **Update worker to use shared filesystem**:\n    - Configure ClaudeAgentSdk working directory to use the NFS-mounted path (e.g., \u0060/data/src/{project}/{worktree}\u0060)\n    - Worker already runs in the same filesystem context as main app\n    - Verify git operations work on NFS mount (chmod support)\n\n### Phase 4: Cleanup and Testing\n\n11. **Remove session pool resources**:\n    - Delete \u0060modules/sessionpool.bicep\u0060\n    - Remove session pool references from \u0060main.bicep\u0060\n    - Clean up unused parameters\n\n12. **Update deploy script** (\u0060scripts/deploy.ps1\u0060):\n    - Update outputs displayed after deployment\n    - Add worker container app URL to outputs\n\n13. **Update start.sh**:\n    - Revert Tailscale state to \u0060/data/tailscale\u0060 (NFS supports chmod)\n    - Or keep on local filesystem if persistence isn\u0027t needed\n\n14. **Testing**:\n    - Deploy to dev environment\n    - Verify NFS mount works (chmod, git clone, git worktree)\n    - Verify Tailscale connects\n    - Start an agent session and confirm it can read/write to shared filesystem\n    - Verify concurrent sessions work correctly\n    - Test agent worktree isolation\n\n## Key Decisions\n\n- **Single worker container app** vs per-session containers: Single app is simpler, the worker already handles multi-session. Agents are isolated via git worktrees, not containers.\n- **ACA environment recreation**: VNet integration requires recreating the environment. This will cause downtime. Plan for a maintenance window.\n- **Internal ingress only**: Both main app and worker use internal ingress. Tailscale provides external access to the main app. Workers are only accessible within the environment.\n\n## References\n\n- Azure Files NFS setup for ACA: https://azureossd.github.io/2025/10/17/Setting-up-a-NFS-volume-with-Azure-Container-Apps/\n- ACA storage mounts: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/storage-mounts\n- ACA VNet integration: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/vnet-custom\n- Session pool API limitation (no volumes): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resource-manager/containerapps/container-apps-session-pools/create-or-update?view=rest-resource-manager-containerapps-2025-07-01","descriptionLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","descriptionModifiedBy":"nick-boey","status":"Open","statusLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","statusModifiedBy":"nick-boey","type":"Feature","typeLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","typeModifiedBy":"nick-boey","linkedIssues":[],"linkedIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","linkedIssuesModifiedBy":"nick-boey","parentIssues":[],"parentIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","parentIssuesModifiedBy":"nick-boey","priority":2,"priorityLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","priorityModifiedBy":"nick-boey","tags":["aca","nfs","infrastructure","agents"],"tagsLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","tagsModifiedBy":"nick-boey","questions":[],"questionsLastUpdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","workingBranchId":"infra/nfs-worker-container-apps","workingBranchIdLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","workingBranchIdModifiedBy":"nick-boey","executionMode":"Series","createdBy":"nick-boey","createdByLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","lastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","createdAt":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00"}
