{"id":"xJEbSP","title":"Fix session crashes","titleLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00","titleModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","description":"# Bug Investigation: Playwright MCP Serialization Error Causing Container Crashes\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Playwright MCP tools are returning malformed responses that contain .NET type names instead of properly serialized JSON data. This bug appears to be causing container crashes/restarts, with processes being terminated by signals (exit codes 128, 144).\n\n## Evidence\n\n### 1. Malformed Playwright Responses\n\nInstead of returning actual content, Playwright MCP tools return:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nSystem.Collections.Generic.List\u00601[System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary\u00602[System.String,System.Object]]\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\nThis occurs across multiple Playwright tools:\n- \u0060mcp__playwright__browser_navigate\u0060\n- \u0060mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot\u0060\n- \u0060mcp__playwright__browser_click\u0060\n- \u0060mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot\u0060\n- \u0060mcp__playwright__browser_press_key\u0060\n- \u0060mcp__playwright__browser_close\u0060\n\n### 2. Affected Sessions\n\nAnalysis of 11 session logs shows:\n- **72\u002B instances** of this serialization error across 9 session files\n- Sessions with Playwright usage have higher rates of abnormal termination\n- Sessions end abruptly (USER message as last entry) when Playwright is heavily used\n\n### 3. Exit Codes Indicating Signal Termination\n\n| Exit Code | Meaning | Occurrences |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| 128 | Process killed by signal | 24 |\n| 144 | Signal 16 (SIGUSR1) | 4 |\n\nExit codes \u2265128 indicate the process was terminated by a signal, not a normal exit. This suggests the container runtime (Docker) killed the process, likely due to resource exhaustion.\n\n### 4. Connection Errors Following Playwright Usage\n\nMultiple sessions show \u0060ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED\u0060 errors after Playwright tool calls, indicating the server became unavailable mid-session.\n\n## Your Task\n\n1. **Locate the Playwright MCP implementation** - Find where the MCP server handles Playwright tool responses\n\n2. **Identify the serialization bug** - The code is likely calling \u0060.ToString()\u0060 on a \u0060List\u003CDictionary\u003Cstring, object\u003E\u003E\u0060 instead of properly serializing it to JSON. Look for:\n   - Response handling code for Playwright tools\n   - JSON serialization of tool results\n   - Any place where \u0060List\u003C\u003E\u0060 or \u0060Dictionary\u003C\u003E\u0060 types are converted to strings\n\n3. **Check for resource leaks** - The repeated malformed responses may indicate:\n   - Browser instances not being properly disposed\n   - Memory leaks from screenshot/snapshot operations\n   - Unclosed connections or streams\n\n4. **Fix the serialization** - Ensure all Playwright tool responses are properly serialized using \u0060System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Serialize()\u0060 or equivalent, not \u0060.ToString()\u0060\n\n5. **Add error handling** - Ensure Playwright errors don\u0027t crash the MCP server:\n   - Wrap browser operations in try-catch\n   - Properly dispose resources on error\n   - Return structured error responses instead of crashing\n\n## Expected vs Actual Behavior\n\n**Expected:** Playwright tools return JSON-serialized content:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060json\n{\n  \u0022content\u0022: [{\u0022type\u0022: \u0022text\u0022, \u0022text\u0022: \u0022Navigation successful\u0022}],\n  \u0022isError\u0022: false\n}\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n**Actual:** Tools return .NET type name as a string:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\nSystem.Collections.Generic.List\u00601[System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary\u00602[System.String,System.Object]]\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Files to Investigate\n\nLook for files related to:\n- MCP server implementation\n- Playwright tool handlers\n- Tool response serialization\n- Any \u0060IToolHandler\u0060 or similar interface implementations\n\nSearch patterns:\n\u0060\u0060\u0060bash\n# Find Playwright-related MCP code\nrg -l \u0022playwright\u0022 --type cs\nrg -l \u0022mcp.*tool|tool.*handler\u0022 --type cs -i\n\n# Find serialization code\nrg \u0022List\u003CDictionary\u003Cstring\u0022 --type cs\nrg \u0022ToString\\(\\)\u0022 --type cs -A2 -B2 | grep -i \u0022result\\|response\\|content\u0022\n\n# Find MCP response building\nrg \u0022ToolResult|McpResponse|CallToolResult\u0022 --type cs\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Start a session with Playwright MCP tools enabled\n2. Use any Playwright tool (navigate, click, snapshot, etc.)\n3. Observe the tool response - it should show the .NET type name instead of actual content\n4. After several Playwright operations, the container may crash or become unresponsive\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] Playwright tools return properly serialized JSON responses\n- [ ] No .NET type names appear in tool output\n- [ ] Sessions with heavy Playwright usage complete without abnormal termination\n- [ ] Exit codes remain 0 (normal) rather than 128\u002B (signal-terminated)\n- [ ] No \u0060ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED\u0060 errors after Playwright operations\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThis bug only started occurring after Playwright MCP tools were introduced. Sessions without Playwright usage do not exhibit the crash behavior. The correlation between Playwright usage and container crashes is strong across all analyzed session logs.","descriptionLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:33.4317784+00:00","descriptionModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","status":"Closed","statusLastUpdate":"2026-02-03T02:19:22.4903551+00:00","statusModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","type":"Bug","typeLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00","typeModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","linkedIssues":[],"linkedIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00","linkedIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","parentIssues":[],"parentIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00","parentIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","tags":[],"tagsLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00","tagsModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","questions":[],"questionsLastUpdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","executionMode":"Series","createdBy":"Homespun Bot","createdByLastUpdate":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00","lastUpdate":"2026-02-03T02:19:22.4903551+00:00","createdAt":"2026-02-02T21:48:19.9003575+00:00"}

This appears to have broken the session display almost entirely - very few messages are displayed other than tool calls in the message window, and there is often a duplicate display of tool calls at the bottom of the chat session.\n\nCould you please review the message caching system, the message format and the history of messages at /data/sessions/ as well as the current chat messages that are being sent to diagnose this issue?

{"id":"Gzrifd","title":"Replace ACA session pools with NFS-mounted worker container apps","titleLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","titleModifiedBy":"nick-boey","description":"## Problem\n\nAzure Container Apps session pools do not support volume mounts (confirmed in the 2025-07-01 API). This prevents agent worker containers from sharing a filesystem with the main application container. Currently:\n\n- The Azure Files SMB mount does not support chmod, breaking both Tailscale state and git clone operations\n- Agent workers cannot access cloned repositories on the shared filesystem\n- Each worker must clone repos independently, duplicating data and bandwidth\n\nThe goal is for the main app and all agent containers to mount the same NFS file share and treat repositories as a local filesystem. Agents work in their own git worktrees, minimising file operation conflicts.\n\n## Solution\n\nReplace ACA session pools with regular container apps for agent workers, backed by Azure Files NFS which supports full POSIX permissions. The worker already manages multiple sessions via HTTP API internally (WorkerSessionService), so a single worker container app can handle concurrent sessions without per-session container isolation.\n\n## Work Breakdown\n\n### Phase 1: Infrastructure - VNet \u002B NFS Storage\n\nThe ACA environment requires VNet integration at creation time (cannot be added post-creation), and NFS requires the storage account to be accessible from within that VNet.\n\n1. **Add VNet and subnets to Bicep** - Create a new \u0060network.bicep\u0060 module:\n   - VNet with address space (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)\n   - ACA infrastructure subnet (e.g., 10.0.0.0/23 - ACA requires minimum /23)\n   - Storage private endpoint subnet (e.g., 10.0.2.0/24)\n\n2. **Update environment module** (\u0060modules/environment.bicep\u0060):\n   - Add \u0060vnetConfiguration\u0060 with infrastructure subnet ID\n   - Set \u0060internal: true\u0060 for internal-only environment (Tailscale handles external access)\n\n3. **Switch storage to NFS** (\u0060modules/storage.bicep\u0060):\n   - Change \u0060enabledProtocols\u0060 from \u0060\u0027SMB\u0027\u0060 to \u0060\u0027NFS\u0027\u0060\n   - Set \u0060supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: false\u0060 (NFS requires this)\n   - Keep \u0060Premium_LRS\u0060 / \u0060FileStorage\u0060 (already correct tier)\n\n4. **Add private endpoint for storage** - New \u0060storage-endpoint.bicep\u0060 module:\n   - Create private endpoint for the storage account on the storage subnet\n   - Create private DNS zone for \u0060privatelink.file.core.windows.net\u0060\n   - Link DNS zone to VNet\n\n5. **Update environment storage mount** (\u0060modules/environment.bicep\u0060):\n   - Change from \u0060azureFile\u0060 (SMB with account key) to \u0060nfsAzureFile\u0060 (NFS, no key needed)\n   - NFS uses network-based auth, so \u0060storageAccountKey\u0060 parameter can be removed\n\n### Phase 2: Infrastructure - Worker Container App\n\nReplace the session pool module with a regular container app for workers.\n\n6. **Create worker container app module** (\u0060modules/worker-containerapp.bicep\u0060):\n   - Regular \u0060Microsoft.App/containerApps\u0060 resource (like main app)\n   - Mount the same NFS volume from the environment storage\n   - Volume mount path: \u0060/data\u0060 (same as main app, shared filesystem)\n   - Environment variables: GitHub token, Claude OAuth (from Key Vault secrets)\n   - Ingress: internal only (only accessible within the ACA environment)\n   - Target port: 8080 (worker HTTP API)\n   - Scaling: min 1, max based on \u0060maxConcurrentSessions\u0060 parameter\n   - HTTP scaling rule based on concurrent requests\n   - Include \u0060revisionSuffix\u0060 with deployment timestamp (same pattern as main app)\n\n7. **Update main.bicep**:\n   - Add network module deployment\n   - Pass VNet/subnet IDs to environment module\n   - Replace session pool module with worker container app module\n   - Pass worker container app FQDN as output\n   - Remove session pool outputs, add worker app outputs\n\n### Phase 3: Application - Agent Execution Service\n\nThe worker already handles multiple sessions via its HTTP API (POST /api/sessions, /api/sessions/{id}/message, etc). The main change is how the main app connects to the worker.\n\n8. **Create new execution service** or update \u0060AzureContainerAppsAgentExecutionService\u0060:\n   - Remove all Azure Management API calls for session pool management (no more creating/deleting pool sessions via PUT/DELETE to the sessions API)\n   - Configure worker endpoint as a simple base URL (worker container app\u0027s internal FQDN)\n   - Route all HTTP/SSE calls directly to the worker container app\n   - Session lifecycle: worker manages sessions internally (already implemented in WorkerSessionService)\n   - StartSession: POST to \u0060http://{worker-fqdn}/api/sessions\u0060\n   - SendMessage: POST to \u0060http://{worker-fqdn}/api/sessions/{id}/message\u0060\n   - StopSession: DELETE to \u0060http://{worker-fqdn}/api/sessions/{id}\u0060\n   - Health check: GET \u0060http://{worker-fqdn}/api/health\u0060\n\n9. **Update configuration** (\u0060AgentExecutionOptions.cs\u0060 and \u0060appsettings.json\u0060):\n   - Add \u0060WorkerEndpoint\u0060 setting (internal FQDN of worker container app)\n   - Remove session pool specific settings (SubscriptionId, ResourceGroup, SessionPoolName)\n   - Or keep the existing ACA mode and add a new property for the worker endpoint\n\n10. **Update worker to use shared filesystem**:\n    - Configure ClaudeAgentSdk working directory to use the NFS-mounted path (e.g., \u0060/data/src/{project}/{worktree}\u0060)\n    - Worker already runs in the same filesystem context as main app\n    - Verify git operations work on NFS mount (chmod support)\n\n### Phase 4: Cleanup and Testing\n\n11. **Remove session pool resources**:\n    - Delete \u0060modules/sessionpool.bicep\u0060\n    - Remove session pool references from \u0060main.bicep\u0060\n    - Clean up unused parameters\n\n12. **Update deploy script** (\u0060scripts/deploy.ps1\u0060):\n    - Update outputs displayed after deployment\n    - Add worker container app URL to outputs\n\n13. **Update start.sh**:\n    - Revert Tailscale state to \u0060/data/tailscale\u0060 (NFS supports chmod)\n    - Or keep on local filesystem if persistence isn\u0027t needed\n\n14. **Testing**:\n    - Deploy to dev environment\n    - Verify NFS mount works (chmod, git clone, git worktree)\n    - Verify Tailscale connects\n    - Start an agent session and confirm it can read/write to shared filesystem\n    - Verify concurrent sessions work correctly\n    - Test agent worktree isolation\n\n## Key Decisions\n\n- **Single worker container app** vs per-session containers: Single app is simpler, the worker already handles multi-session. Agents are isolated via git worktrees, not containers.\n- **ACA environment recreation**: VNet integration requires recreating the environment. This will cause downtime. Plan for a maintenance window.\n- **Internal ingress only**: Both main app and worker use internal ingress. Tailscale provides external access to the main app. Workers are only accessible within the environment.\n\n## References\n\n- Azure Files NFS setup for ACA: https://azureossd.github.io/2025/10/17/Setting-up-a-NFS-volume-with-Azure-Container-Apps/\n- ACA storage mounts: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/storage-mounts\n- ACA VNet integration: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/vnet-custom\n- Session pool API limitation (no volumes): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resource-manager/containerapps/container-apps-session-pools/create-or-update?view=rest-resource-manager-containerapps-2025-07-01","descriptionLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","descriptionModifiedBy":"nick-boey","status":"Closed","statusLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T05:03:11.7476502+00:00","statusModifiedBy":"nick-boey","type":"Feature","typeLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","typeModifiedBy":"nick-boey","linkedIssues":[],"linkedIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","linkedIssuesModifiedBy":"nick-boey","parentIssues":[],"parentIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","parentIssuesModifiedBy":"nick-boey","priority":2,"priorityLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","priorityModifiedBy":"nick-boey","tags":["aca","nfs","infrastructure","agents"],"tagsLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","tagsModifiedBy":"nick-boey","questions":[],"questionsLastUpdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","executionMode":"Series","createdBy":"nick-boey","createdByLastUpdate":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00","lastUpdate":"2026-02-07T05:03:11.7476502+00:00","createdAt":"2026-02-07T01:18:30.2634273+00:00"}

These npm global installs (especially Claude Code with node-pty native compilation, and Playwright MCP \u002B Chromium at ~1GB) are the primary bottleneck. Every code change rebuilds all of this from scratch. The CI/CD pipeline (cd.yml) also has zero caching configured.\n\nApproach: Shared Base Image \u002B CI Caching\n\n1. Create Dockerfile.base - shared tooling image with all common runtime tools (.NET 10 SDK, Node.js, gh CLI, Claude Code, Playwright MCP \u002B Chromium, Fleece CLI, Docker CLI). Use BuildKit cache mounts on npm install steps.\n\n2. Modify Dockerfile - change runtime stage FROM to use base image. Keep only main-app-specific items (Tailscale, user setup, published app copy).\n\n3. Modify src/Homespun.AgentWorker/Dockerfile - same pattern, keep only worker-specific items.\n\n4. Update scripts/run.sh - build base image first before app builds. Docker layer cache makes this instant when base unchanged.\n\n5. Update scripts/run.ps1 - same change for PowerShell.\n\n6. Update .github/workflows/cd.yml - add BuildKit (setup-buildx-action), add build-base-image job, use registry cache (cache-from/cache-to), upgrade build-push-action to v6.\n\nFiles to modify: Dockerfile.base (new), Dockerfile, src/Homespun.AgentWorker/Dockerfile, scripts/run.sh, scripts/run.ps1, .github/workflows/cd.yml\n\nExpected impact: Local code-only rebuild ~2-5 min (from ~15-20 min).

this is a pure API server\n- CORS must be configured to allow the WASM client to make requests\n- The server hosts the WASM client\u0027s files via \u0060UseBlazorFrameworkFiles()\u0060/\u0060MapFallbackToFile\u0060\n- Service interfaces that the client needs (for strongly-typed HTTP clients) should reference types from Homespun.Shared only\n- No reference to Homespun.Worker is needed in the .csproj \u2014 communication is over HTTP at runtime\n\n## Verification\n- Project compiles independently\n- All API endpoints are accessible via Swagger\n- SignalR hubs accept connections\n- Health check endpoint works","descriptionLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T22:29:06.9891765+00:00","descriptionModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","status":"Complete","statusLastUpdate":"2026-02-09T00:11:16.8473849+00:00","statusModifiedBy":"nick-boey","type":"Task","typeLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:41:56.6532203+00:00","typeModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","linkedIssues":[],"linkedIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:41:56.6532203+00:00","linkedIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","parentIssues":[{"parentIssue":"oU1zLd","sortOrder":"bbb"}],"parentIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:41:56.6532203+00:00","parentIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","tags":[],"tagsLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:41:56.6532203+00:00","tagsModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","questions":[],"questionsLastUpdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","executionMode":"Series","createdBy":"Homespun Bot","createdByLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:41:56.6532203+00:00","lastUpdate":"2026-02-09T00:11:16.8473849+00:00","createdAt":"2026-02-08T20:41:56.6532203+00:00"}

They must use HttpClient or SignalR\n2. **No \u0060@rendermode InteractiveServer\u0060** - Remove all rendermode directives; WASM is the default\n3. **HttpClient for data fetching** - Replace direct service calls with HTTP API calls\n4. **SignalR client connections** - Use \u0060HubConnectionBuilder\u0060 from the client instead of being part of the hub server\n5. **No server-side state** - All UI state lives in the browser; use local storage or session storage if needed\n6. **Tailwind CSS build** - Move the npm/tailwind build into this project since it\u0027s the UI project\n\n### wwwroot/index.html\nCreate the HTML host page (replaces App.razor server rendering):\n\u0060\u0060\u0060html\n\u003C!DOCTYPE html\u003E\n\u003Chtml lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Chead\u003E\n    \u003Cmeta charset=\u0022utf-8\u0022 /\u003E\n    \u003Ctitle\u003EHomespun\u003C/title\u003E\n    \u003Cbase href=\u0022/\u0022 /\u003E\n    \u003Clink href=\u0022css/tailwind.min.css\u0022 rel=\u0022stylesheet\u0022 /\u003E\n    \u003Clink href=\u0022css/app.css\u0022 rel=\u0022stylesheet\u0022 /\u003E\n    \u003Clink href=\u0022Homespun.Client.styles.css\u0022 rel=\u0022stylesheet\u0022 /\u003E\n\u003C/head\u003E\n\u003Cbody class=\u0022bg-gray-950 text-gray-100\u0022\u003E\n    \u003Cdiv id=\u0022app\u0022\u003ELoading...\u003C/div\u003E\n    \u003Cscript src=\u0022_framework/blazor.webassembly.js\u0022\u003E\u003C/script\u003E\n\u003C/body\u003E\n\u003C/html\u003E\n\u0060\u0060\u0060\n\n## Verification\n- Project compiles with \u0060dotnet build\u0060\n- \u0060dotnet run\u0060 on the Server project serves the WASM client\n- Basic routing works (navigating between pages)\n- Initial page loads show the layout with nav menu","descriptionLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:42:21.2936805+00:00","descriptionModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","status":"Complete","statusLastUpdate":"2026-02-09T00:23:53.7064571+00:00","statusModifiedBy":"nick-boey","type":"Task","typeLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:42:21.2936805+00:00","typeModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","linkedIssues":[],"linkedIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:42:21.2936805+00:00","linkedIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","parentIssues":[{"parentIssue":"oU1zLd","sortOrder":"ccc"}],"parentIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:42:21.2936805+00:00","parentIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","tags":[],"tagsLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:42:21.2936805+00:00","tagsModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","questions":[],"questionsLastUpdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","executionMode":"Series","createdBy":"Homespun Bot","createdByLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:42:21.2936805+00:00","lastUpdate":"2026-02-09T00:23:53.7064571+00:00","createdAt":"2026-02-08T20:42:21.2936805+00:00"}

Copy the entire Features/ directory to Homespun.Server/Features/\n2. Update namespaces from \u0060Homespun.Features.*\u0060 to \u0060Homespun.Server.Features.*\u0060\n3. Update service interfaces that reference shared types to use \u0060Homespun.Shared.*\u0060 namespaces\n4. Keep service interfaces that are server-internal (not needed by client) in the Server project\n5. Move \u0060Program.cs\u0060 DI registration code to the server\n\n## Key decisions\n- Service interfaces that the client needs to know about (for HTTP client wrappers) remain in Shared as marker interfaces or are defined fresh there\n- Server-only interfaces (ICommandRunner, IClaudeSessionDiscovery, etc.) stay in Server\n- The \u0060IBreadcrumbService\u0060 may need to be reimplemented client-side since it tracks navigation state\n- Agent execution services remain in the server \u2014 they orchestrate Homespun.Worker containers but do not need a .csproj reference to Homespun.Worker (communication is HTTP-based at runtime)\n\n## Verification\n- Server project builds\n- All API endpoints work\n- SignalR connections work\n- Mock mode still functions\n- Existing unit tests can be pointed at the new project and pass","descriptionLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T22:29:32.5219948+00:00","descriptionModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","status":"Complete","statusLastUpdate":"2026-02-09T00:38:52.6083914+00:00","statusModifiedBy":"nick-boey","type":"Task","typeLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:42:48.3391236+00:00","typeModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","linkedIssues":[],"linkedIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:42:48.3391236+00:00","linkedIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","parentIssues":[{"parentIssue":"oU1zLd","sortOrder":"ddd"}],"parentIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:42:48.3391236+00:00","parentIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","tags":[],"tagsLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:42:48.3391236+00:00","tagsModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","questions":[],"questionsLastUpdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","executionMode":"Series","createdBy":"Homespun Bot","createdByLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:42:48.3391236+00:00","lastUpdate":"2026-02-09T00:38:52.6083914+00:00","createdAt":"2026-02-08T20:42:48.3391236+00:00"}

the \u0060Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Server\u0060 package approach)\n- The published output should contain both the server DLL and the \u0060wwwroot/_framework/\u0060 directory with WASM files\n- **Homespun.Worker** (TypeScript/Hono) has its own separate Dockerfile (\u0060src/Homespun.Worker/Dockerfile\u0060) and builds independently \u2014 it is NOT part of the .NET server build\n\n## start.sh changes\n- Update the entrypoint to run \u0060Homespun.Server.dll\u0060 instead of \u0060Homespun.dll\u0060\n- Health check URL should remain the same (\u0060/health\u0060)\n\n## CI/CD workflow changes\n\n### ci.yml (CI pipeline)\n- Update build command to build the full solution (which already happens with \u0060dotnet build\u0060)\n- Update test commands if test project references changed\n- Ensure Tailwind CSS build step targets the Client project\n- Homespun.Worker TypeScript tests (\u0060npm test\u0060 in \u0060src/Homespun.Worker/\u0060) should continue to run as before\n\n### cd.yml (CD pipeline)\n- Update the main image build to publish \u0060Homespun.Server\u0060\n- The **Homespun.Worker** image builds from \u0060src/Homespun.Worker/Dockerfile\u0060 \u2014 this remains unchanged\n- Update build args if needed\n\n## Solution file changes\n- Add \u0060Homespun.Shared\u0060, \u0060Homespun.Server\u0060, \u0060Homespun.Client\u0060 to the solution\n- Remove the old \u0060Homespun\u0060 project from the solution (or keep it temporarily during transition)\n- \u0060Homespun.Worker\u0060 (TypeScript) is referenced in the solution for IDE convenience but is not a .csproj project\n- Update solution folder nesting\n\n## launchSettings.json\n- Create launch profiles for the Server project\n- The development workflow: run \u0060Homespun.Server\u0060 which serves both API and WASM client\n- Mock mode should still work via environment variables\n\n## Infrastructure (Bicep) changes\n- Update \u0060infra/main.bicep\u0060 container app configuration if the entry point changed\n- Update any container image references\n- Homespun.Worker container app configuration remains unchanged\n\n## docker-compose changes\n- Update the main service to build and run \u0060Homespun.Server\u0060\n- The worker service continues to use \u0060src/Homespun.Worker/Dockerfile\u0060\n- Ensure networking between Server and Worker containers is correct\n\n## Verification\n- \u0060docker build\u0060 succeeds for both Server and Worker images\n- Container starts and serves the WASM client at the root URL\n- API endpoints accessible at \u0060/api/*\u0060\n- Health check passes at \u0060/health\u0060\n- CI pipeline passes\n- Mock mode works in container\n- Worker containers can be spawned by the Server for agent execution","descriptionLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T22:29:59.4428171+00:00","descriptionModifiedBy":"Homespun

The Homespun.Worker TypeScript tests are independent and should continue working as-is.\n\n## Homespun.Tests (Unit Tests)\n\n### Project reference changes\n- Remove reference to old \u0060Homespun\u0060 project\n- Add reference to \u0060Homespun.Server\u0060 (for testing server-side services)\n- Add reference to \u0060Homespun.Shared\u0060 (for shared types)\n- Update \u0060InternalsVisibleTo\u0060 in \u0060Homespun.Server.csproj\u0060 to include \u0060Homespun.Tests\u0060\n\n### Namespace updates\n- Update all \u0060using Homespun.Features.*\u0060 to \u0060using Homespun.Server.Features.*\u0060\n- Update all \u0060using Homespun.Components.*\u0060 references if any bUnit tests exist\n\n### bUnit component tests\n- These currently test Blazor Server components. They need to be updated to test the WASM client components instead\n- Change project reference from Server to Client for component tests\n- If both server and client tests are needed, consider splitting into separate test projects or using conditional compilation\n- Update service mocks: instead of mocking \u0060IProjectService\u0060, mock \u0060HttpProjectApiService\u0060 or use a mock \u0060HttpClient\u0060 via \u0060HttpMessageHandler\u0060\n\n### Service unit tests\n- These should largely work as-is since they test service implementations that moved to \u0060Homespun.Server\u0060\n- Update namespaces\n- Verify all test fixtures still resolve correctly\n\n## Homespun.Api.Tests (API Integration Tests)\n\n### Project reference changes\n- Change \u0060WebApplicationFactory\u003CProgram\u003E\u0060 to reference the new \u0060Homespun.Server\u0060 project\n- The \u0060Program\u0060 class now lives in \u0060Homespun.Server\u0060\n- Update \u0060InternalsVisibleTo\u0060 in \u0060Homespun.Server.csproj\u0060 to include \u0060Homespun.Api.Tests\u0060\n\n### Test updates\n- Update namespace references\n- Verify all existing API tests still pass (the endpoints should be identical)\n- Add new tests for CORS headers if needed\n- Add tests verifying the WASM static file serving works\n\n### WebApplicationFactory configuration\n\\\u0060\\\u0060\\\u0060csharp\npublic class HomespunApiFactory : WebApplicationFactory\u003CHomespun.Server.Program\u003E\n{\n    protected override void ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder builder)\n    {\n        builder.UseEnvironment(\u0022Testing\u0022);\n        // Configure test services\n    }\n}\n\\\u0060\\\u0060\\\u0060\n\n## Homespun.E2E.Tests (End-to-End Tests)\n\n### Changes\n- These tests use Playwright to interact with the browser - they should work largely unchanged since the URL structure stays the same\n- Update the \u0060HomespunFixture\u0060 to start \u0060Homespun.Server\u0060 instead of the old \u0060Homespun\u0060 project\n- The server now serves the WASM client, so page navigation should work the same way\n- May need to add waits for WASM initialization (the app takes longer to load initially compared to Blazor Server)\n- Consider adding a loading/splash screen check\n\n### Potential issues\n- **Initial load time**: Blazor WASM has a longer initial load than Server. E2E tests may need increased timeouts or explicit waits for WASM initialization\n- **WebSocket connections**: Playwright may need to wait for SignalR connections to be established before interacting with real-time features\n\n## Homespun.Worker Tests (TypeScript - Vitest)\n- The \u0060tests/Homespun.Worker/\u0060 test suite (81 Vitest tests) is independent of the .NET project split\n- These tests should continue to pass without modification\n- Ensure CI continues to run \u0060npm test\u0060 in the Worker test directory\n\n## New test considerations\n\n### Client-side integration tests\nConsider adding a new test project \u0060Homespun.Client.Tests\u0060 for:\n- bUnit tests for WASM components\n- Testing HTTP service classes with mocked HttpClient\n- Testing SignalR service classes with mocked HubConnection\n\n### Test data\n- Existing test data in \u0060tests/data/sessions/\u0060 should remain compatible\n- Mock mode should still work via the Server project\n\n## Verification\n- All unit tests pass: \u0060dotnet test tests/Homespun.Tests/\u0060\n- All API tests pass: \u0060dotnet test tests/Homespun.Api.Tests/\u0060\n- All E2E tests pass: \u0060dotnet test tests/Homespun.E2E.Tests/\u0060\n- All Worker tests pass: \u0060npm test\u0060 in \u0060tests/Homespun.Worker/\u0060\n- Test coverage is maintained or improved","descriptionLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T22:30:28.5764057+00:00","descriptionModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","status":"Complete","statusLastUpdate":"2026-02-09T05:36:43.9364805+00:00","statusModifiedBy":"nick-boey","type":"Task","typeLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:45:02.0650305+00:00","typeModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","linkedIssues":[],"linkedIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:45:02.0650305+00:00","linkedIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","parentIssues":[{"parentIssue":"oU1zLd","sortOrder":"iii"}],"parentIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:45:02.0650305+00:00","parentIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","tags":[],"tagsLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:45:02.0650305+00:00","tagsModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","questions":[],"questionsLastUpdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","executionMode":"Series","createdBy":"Homespun Bot","createdByLastUpdate":"2026-02-08T20:45:02.0650305+00:00","lastUpdate":"2026-02-09T05:36:43.9364805+00:00","createdAt":"2026-02-08T20:45:02.0650305+00:00"}

It is currently assuming that the first answer provided is the correct one and proceeding anyway. This is required only for the local execution mode as in the local execution mode the instance of Claude Code by default will just continue execution.\n\nHowever, we are using the Typescript version of the Claude Agent SDK in Docker and Azure Container Apps execution modes, which allows this flow. Refer to https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript#ask-user-question and https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/user-input#handle-clarifying-questions for information on how the SDK handles clarifying questions.\n\nPlans operate somewhat differently. Review the code and documentation and see if you can come up with a plan to fix this behaviour for the Docker and Agent Execution modes. The SDK has recently been changed to V1, so this may be fixed or it may require minor updates to the code.\n\nIf it will simplify things, OK to remove specific handling for questions and tools from the Local execution mode. Otherwise, if they are handled separately and don\u0027t interact in the different modes then OK to leave it as is.","descriptionLastUpdate":"2026-02-12T23:14:26.4313849+00:00","descriptionModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","status":"Open","statusLastUpdate":"2026-02-12T02:25:15.457194+00:00","statusModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","type":"Bug","typeLastUpdate":"2026-02-12T02:25:15.457194+00:00","typeModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","linkedIssues":[],"linkedIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-12T02:25:15.457194+00:00","linkedIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","parentIssues":[],"parentIssuesLastUpdate":"2026-02-12T02:25:15.457194+00:00","parentIssuesModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","tags":[],"tagsLastUpdate":"2026-02-12T02:25:15.457194+00:00","tagsModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","questions":[],"questionsLastUpdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","workingBranchId":"fix-answer-plan-modes","workingBranchIdLastUpdate":"2026-02-12T02:25:18.2917879+00:00","workingBranchIdModifiedBy":"Homespun Bot","executionMode":"Series","createdBy":"Homespun Bot","createdByLastUpdate":"2026-02-12T02:25:15.457194+00:00","lastUpdate":"2026-02-12T23:14:26.4313849+00:00","createdAt":"2026-02-12T02:25:15.457194+00:00"}
